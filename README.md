# Getting started with FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a Python fast and lightweight web framework for building modern APIs with Python 3.6+. In this tutorial, you will be walked through building an app with FastAPI. You will get to understand why FastAPI was nominated as [one of the best open-source frameworks of the year](https://twitter.com/fastapi/status/1451217908856758275).

FastAPI is not only limited to building APIs, you can also use it to deliver static web pages using its Jinja2 templating engine to serve your web apps using [WebSockets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-socket-and-how-it-is-different-from-the-http/).
